# Changing-Room-Coding-Challenge
## Description
For this coding challenge, I was asked to create a web crawling application using Python. I used BeautifulSoup as my main library to crawl the website www.fordays.com. Since I was tasked to crawl not the entire website but a few products, I cralwed the products and their attributes of the womens' tops section. In this file, I will explain every step I took to complete the coding challenge and my strategy towards how to scrape the entire website as well as making automatic updates after storing in Postgresql database.
